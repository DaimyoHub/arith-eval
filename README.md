# Arithmetical expression interpreter

This project is an arithmetical expression evaluator. It is not perfectly
working yet since priority of operations are not implemented, except for 
parentheses.

In other words :
  - this expression is well evaluated : `((3 * 4) / 2) + 5`
  - this expression is not : `3 * 4 / 2 + 5`
